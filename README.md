Analyzing data:

 

1. Dividing dataset in 5 categories
Face conture = [0:26]
Nose = [27, 35]
Eyes = [27, 28, 36:47]
Lips = [48:67]
and Face overral which consists of all point.

2. Creating networks

To analyze data we should have a separate network for each category of data. We need to implement CNN, Bayesian network and Hidden Markov network each. To minimize the number of features the one shall use PCA algorithm(described in face_rating repository)
